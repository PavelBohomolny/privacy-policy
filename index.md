# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 26.08.2024

## General Information

**SimpleThings Apps** are all released in the AppStore under Pavlo Bohomolnyis' personal account.

On the most basic level, I value your privacy and make decisions in our development to respect it to the best of our ability.

## Storage and Sync

All my apps store your data locally on the devices you use.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

No Personally-Identifying Information is transmitted to external locations when using SimpleThings Apps.

Non-personally identifiable information, such as device type and operating system version, is sent to our servers. This is used in aggregate to help facilitate development decisions.

## HealthKit Data

If you choose to have SimpleThings Apps integrated with HealthKit, the application will have access only to the health data types you opt in to access.

The health data read from HealthKit is displayed within the app. It is not collected or disclosed outside of your local app installation. Only those data types relevant to the app are accessed.

SimpleThings Apps requests permission to write certain data types into your HealthKit data store.

Your health data is never transferred to a third party. It is only kept within the application container of SimpleThings Apps or transferred to your personal HealthKit data store as per your permission choices.
